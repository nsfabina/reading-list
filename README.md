#A Data Science / Software Engineering Reading List

These books come highly recommended from colleagues and other sources.

Mildly interesting aside for discussion fodder:  I've noticed that data science books tend to be very hands-on, engineering books are practical and straightforward, and design books often have detailed narratives.

Author names are a Google search away.
