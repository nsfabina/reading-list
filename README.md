# A reading list for generalists:  data science, software engineering, and design

These books came highly recommended from colleagues and other sources, and my impressions fell into three categories:
- mind-blowing:  read the whole thing
- flashes of brilliance:  read useful sections, skim outdated or irrelevant sections, or content covered in other books
- not my cup of tea:  give it a shot, stop reading if you don't find it useful

Discussion fodder:  I've noticed that data science books tend to be very hands-on, engineering books are practical and straightforward, and design books often have detailed narratives and flowery language.

Author names are a Google search away.
